                    <p class="text-p">Bun is the traditional coffee ceremony of Eritrea and Ethiopia. Fresh coffee beans are roast over a small open furnace. In order to ensure an even roast, the host continuously turns the beans. As she turns the beans, your nose is filled with the aroma of fresh coffee intermingled with hints of fruit and flowers. Once the beans are evenly roasted, the host passes the pan of roasted beans in front of everyone&apos;s face &#8211; giving you a better smell of the emitting fragrances. The smell is nothing like what you would expect. Unlike the smell of coffee from your local Starbucks, this Ethiopian coffee has a fruity, sweet smell that just warms your soul. The host then pours the beans into a wooden bowl called a <strong>megudbun.</strong>The<em>megudbun</em> is used to grind the beans by hand. Finally, the coffee grounds are poured into a jebena, which is a pot is made of thick clay. The jebena is extremely functional in that it ensures the coffee grounds don't burn over the open furnace. Water is added to the jebena and then the mixture is boiled. It is served in small cups called finjal accompanied by sugar and milk, and there is typically kitcha, popcorn, or some form of sweets to be eaten with the coffee. Additionally, etan, an incense-like fragrant powder is burned atop hot charcoal to provide a wonderful aroma to the room. There is a routine of serving coffee daily, mainly for the purpose of getting together with relatives, neighbors, or other visitors.</p>
